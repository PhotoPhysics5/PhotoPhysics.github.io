**Description of our Project**\
Physics, along with Math, is considered to be one of the most challending classes students take in High School as well as in post-secondary institutions. Given the great abundance of smartphones and math-solving technology, how great would it be if they could solve our physics problems too? Inspired by the already existing PhotoMath, PhotoPhysics is an innovated mobile application which uses a specific algorithmic technology, allowing for the solving and visualizing of various types of Physics Word Problems.
